# React Router Auto Routes

Automatic folder-based routing with colocation for React Router v7+.

## Philosophy

Built on [convention-over-configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) principlesâ€”your file structure defines your routes automatically, with smart defaults that just work, and scale well.

[Colocation](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation) is a first-class feature:

> "Place code as close to where it's relevant as possible" â€” Kent C. Dodds

Keep your components, tests, utilities, and routes together. No more hunting across folders or artificial separation of concerns. The `+` prefix lets you organize naturally while the router stays out of your way.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Prefix-based colocation** - Keep helpers and components alongside routes using `+` prefix
- âš¡ **ESM-only** - Built for modern tooling
- ðŸ§¹ **Clean API** - Simplified options and intuitive conventions
- ðŸš« **Zero legacy** - No CommonJS, no pre-Vite Remix support

## Installation

```bash
npm install -D react-router-auto-routes
```

## Quick Start

```ts
// app/routes.ts
import { autoRoutes } from 'react-router-auto-routes'

export default autoRoutes()
```

## Routing Convention

```
routes/
â”œâ”€â”€ _index.tsx           â†’ / (index route)
â”œâ”€â”€ about.tsx            â†’ /about
â”œâ”€â”€ _auth/               â†’ Pathless layout (no /auth in URL)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx      â†’ Auth layout
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ login.tsx        â†’ /login
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ signup.tsx       â†’ /signup
â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx      â†’ Layout for /blog/* routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _index.tsx       â†’ /blog
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ $slug.tsx        â†’ /blog/:slug (dynamic param)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ archive.tsx      â†’ /blog/archive
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx      â†’ Layout for dashboard routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _index.tsx       â†’ /dashboard
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analytics.tsx    â†’ /dashboard/analytics
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings.tsx     â†’ /dashboard/settings
â””â”€â”€ files/
    â””â”€â”€ $.tsx            â†’ /files/* (splat - catch-all)
```

**Route patterns:**

- `_index.tsx` or `index.tsx` - Index routes (match parent's exact path)
- `_layout.tsx` - Layout with `<Outlet />` for child routes
- Other `_` names (like `_auth/`) create pathless layout groups
- `$param` - Dynamic segments (e.g., `$slug` â†’ `:slug`)
- `$.tsx` - Splat routes (catch-all)
- `(segment)` - Optional segments (e.g., `(en)` â†’ `en?`)
- `($param)` - Optional dynamic params (e.g., `($lang)` â†’ `:lang?`)

### Index Route Nesting

Index routes automatically nest under layouts with matching path segments:

```
routes/
â”œâ”€â”€ admin/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx    â†’ /admin layout
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx      â†’ /admin (nested under layout)
```

This generates a nested RouteConfig structure where `admin/index.tsx` becomes a child index route under `admin/_layout.tsx`.

**Key insight:** Folders are just a convenience for organization. Without a parent file, `api/users.ts` behaves exactly like `api.users.ts` - both create the same `/api/users` route.

## Colocation with `+` Prefix

Keep helpers, components, and utilities alongside routes using the `+` prefix. Anything starting with `+` is ignored by the router.

```
routes/
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx          â†’ Route: /dashboard
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ +types.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ +/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helpers.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ +components/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ chart.tsx
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ kpi-card.tsx
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ data-table.tsx
â””â”€â”€ users/
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx          â†’ Route: /users
    â”œâ”€â”€ +user-list.tsx
    â””â”€â”€ $id/
        â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx      â†’ Route: /users/:id
        â”œâ”€â”€ edit.tsx       â†’ Route: /users/:id/edit
        â”œâ”€â”€ +avatar.tsx
        â””â”€â”€ +/
            â”œâ”€â”€ query.ts
            â””â”€â”€ validation.ts
```

## Colocation Rules

**Allowed:**

- `+` prefixed files and folders
- Anonymous folder: `+/`
- Nested folders inside `+` folders

**Disallowed:**

- Root-level `+` entries
- Nested `+/+/` folders

## Configuration Options

```ts
autoRoutes({
  routesDir: {
    '/': 'app/routes',
    '/tools/keyword-analyzer': 'tools/keyword-analyzer/routes',
    '/tools/meta-preview': 'tools/meta-preview/routes',
  },
  ignoredRouteFiles: [
    '**/.*', // Ignore dotfiles
    '**/*.test.{ts,tsx}', // Ignore tests
  ],
  paramChar: '$',
  colocationChar: '+',
  routeRegex: /\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|md|mdx)$/,
})
```

`.DS_Store` is always ignored automatically, even when you provide custom `ignoredRouteFiles`, and the migration CLI inherits the same default.

`routesDir` is flexible:

- `string` â€“ single root (default: `'app/routes'`).
- `Array<string | Record<string, string>>` â€“ mix-and-match convenience (e.g. `['app/routes', { '/docs': 'docs/routes' }]`).
- `Record<string, string>` â€“ explicit URL mount â†’ directory mapping.

Validation highlights:

- Mount paths must start with `/` and may only end with `/` when they are exactly `/`.
- Mount paths cannot repeat.
- Directory values must be relative (no `..`, no leading `/`).
- Manifest IDs mirror the supplied directory (e.g. `tools/keyword-analyzer/routes/index.tsx` â†’ `id: 'tools/keyword-analyzer/routes/index'`).

### Multiple Route Roots

Map different URL mounts to separate folders without redundant nesting:

```ts
autoRoutes({
  routesDir: {
    '/': 'app/routes',
    '/tools/keyword-analyzer': 'tools/keyword-analyzer/routes',
    '/tools/meta-preview': 'tools/meta-preview/routes',
  },
})
```

**Example structure:**

```
app/
  routes/
    dashboard.tsx                  â†’ /dashboard
    settings/
      _layout.tsx                  â†’ /settings
      index.tsx                    â†’ /settings
tools/
  keyword-analyzer/
    routes/
      index.tsx                    â†’ /tools/keyword-analyzer
      reports/index.tsx            â†’ /tools/keyword-analyzer/reports
  meta-preview/
    routes/
      index.tsx                    â†’ /tools/meta-preview
```

Routes from each mount stay isolated when resolving parents and dot-flattening, but still produce a single manifest. You can include additional directories under the root mount by mixing array entries, e.g. `routesDir: ['app/routes', { '/docs': 'docs/routes' }]`.

Dot notation remains supported but optionalâ€”the filesystem shape above produces clean URLs without duplicating segment folders. IDs retain the configured prefix, so the example above yields entries such as `app/routes/dashboard` and `tools/keyword-analyzer/routes/reports/index`.

## Migration Guide

If you're using [remix-flat-routes](https://github.com/kiliman/remix-flat-routes), first uninstall it:

```bash
npm uninstall remix-flat-routes
npm uninstall @react-router/remix-routes-option-adapter
```

## CLI Migration Tool

> **Note:** This tool is designed for projects using [remix-flat-routes](https://github.com/kiliman/remix-flat-routes) 0.8.\*

Migrate your routes automatically:

```bash
npx migrate-auto-routes app/routes

# or provide an explicit destination
npx migrate-auto-routes app/routes app/new-routes
```

The CLI overwrites the target directory if it already exists. When `targetDir` is omitted it defaults to a sibling directory named "new-routes".

**Safety checks:**

- Verifies you are inside a Git repository and the route source directory (e.g. `app/routes`) has no pending changes before running the migration CLI
- Runs `npx react-router routes` before and after rewriting files
- Stages the migrated result in `app/new-routes` (or your custom target) before swapping it into place
- Swaps the new routes into `app/routes`, using `app/old-routes` as a temporary backup during the run
- If the generated route output differs, prints a diff, restores the original directory, and keeps the migrated files at the target path for inspection
- When your project still imports `createRoutesFromFolders`/`remix-flat-routes`, the CLI updates `app/routes.ts` to export `autoRoutes()` so the snapshot check runs against the migrated tree

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 20
- React Router v7+
